Marx 2019-12-20 1 Introduction I started this project with the goal of answering this question: “if you take a character in a novel and replace all direct references to their gender such as pronouns with gender-neutral alternatives, how accurately could you predict their gender?” The steps required to answer this question led to even more questions, and this project’s scope has grown to include examinations of author and genre bias. Gendered stereotypes influence behavior. The embodied approach to cognition views cognition as grounded in the body, so socially imposed perceptions of body might shape gendered behavior (Lee 2016). While writing a novel, an author might image the perspective of their characters. By embodying a character, the author’s cognition becomes grounded in an imaged body and their writing might reflect their interpretation of the body. The interpretation and generalizing of gender differences risks perpetuating stereotypes and gender essentialism (Koolen and Cranenburgh 2017). Examining gender differences in fictional characters provides an opportunity to explore gender stereotypes and examine some of variables confounding the interpretation of lexical differences between male and female authors. Viewing gender through the lens of performativity can sometimes be intepreted to invalidate self-determined queer and trans identities, but TERFS can fuck off (Finlay 2017). "],
["methods.html", "2 Methods 2.1 Book corpus 2.2 Natural language processing 2.3 Differential expression", " 2 Methods 2.1 Book corpus This study used 6,462 of the 10,000 most populared books listed on goodreads.com (Zając 2018). Author gender was estimated using baby name popularity from 20-60 years prior to publication date (Social Security Administration 2019). When multiple authors were listed, the first author’s name was used. I manually annotated the most common authors whose first name was not listed in the database. This method doesn’t account for ghost writers, pen names, multiple authors, writers born outside the United States, or name-gender discrepancies (for example, a person named “Russell” could be non-binary rather than male). To estimate gender accuracy, I manually reviewed 100 entires and found 2 incorrently gendered authors. Gender is not binary, and binary classification of author gender is only a convenient approximation. 2.2 Natural language processing Lemmatization and part-of-speech tagging was performed with Spacy (Honnibal and Montani 2017), and character coreferences were resolved with NeuralCoref (Chaumond 2019). Characters were defined as entities with 50 or more coreferenced pronouns. Character gender was determined by pronoun usage. Bags-of-words were extracted for each sentance where a character was referenced. 2.3 Differential expression The assumptions when comparing bags of words are remarkably similar to those in analyzing differential expression of next-gen RNA sequencing data. I took advantage of this by using DESeq2 to (Love, Huber, and Anders 2014) apply generalized linear models with a negative binomial distribution to estimate differences in word frequency. "],

To examine genre clustering, I created a nearest neighbor graph calculated with the cosine distance between tag frequency for the top 150 tags in the dataset (fig 3.1). Overlaying this graph with author gender show a very large relationship between book genre and author gender (fig 3.2). Tag data is created by readers, and is confounded by a high degree of gender bias in book reviews (Thelwall 2019).

Figure 3.2: Nearest neighbor graph generated by book tag similarity, colored by author gender. 3.2 Character gender by genre Graphs get messy, so I made a table showing the number of books written by male and female author in each genre (fig 3.3). In addition to author, the ratio of character genders varies substantially across genre and author gender (fig 3.4). Figure 3.3: Author gender discrepancy by genre. Figure 3.4: Character gender discrepancy by author gender. 3.3 Character frequency Female minor characters are relatively underrepresented as shown by a reduced probability that female characters make fewer appearances in the text (fig 3.5). This might reflect the concept of “male-as-default”, where non-gender-specific characters are mostly portrayed as male. Figure 3.5: Distribution of characters as percentage of total words.

["results-differential-expression.html", "4 Results - Differential Expression", " 4 Results - Differential Expression To compare lexicons for male and female characters across all authors, I used DESeq2 to compare word frequencies across character gender. This process is computationally intensive, so I only included the 10,000 most frequent words, and the 3000 character with the highest read depth (the entire dataset includes 25,000 characters across 6000 books). Result are visualized in an interactive plot (fig 4.1). Differentially expressed words for female (table 6.1) and male (table 6.2) characters are included in the supplemental data. Figure 4.1: Differential word frequency by character gender Next, I compared lexicons for male and female authors (fig 4.2). A subjective assessment of the data suggests that these differences largely are due to genre. Differentially expressed words are included in supplemental data (tables 6.3 and 6.4 ). Figure 4.2: Differential word frequency by author gender Words that are more frequently associated with male characters are also more frequently used by male authors (fig 4.3). The is likely a consequence of male authors more frequently writing male characters (fig (fig:characterCounts)). I haven’t figured out the best way to control for this difference. I might try weighting word frequency by character gender frequency. Figure 4.3: Correlation between word frequency across character and author gender Next, I trained an ensemble learner to classify characters (table 4.2) and authors (table 4.1) by gender using DESeq2 normalized word counts. This model classified author gender with disturbing accuracy. A bad interpretation wouldn’t examine confounding variables such as genre. I’m not sure how best to do this. Goodreads.com tags are probably rather biased, and not an impartial estimator of genre. I might try classifying books by genre using their text, and independently classifying author by gender within a genre. An alternative method might be to adapt another technique from single-cell RNA-sequencing. I might be able to position books on a manifold in genre-space, and examine how author genders are distributed along the manifold. Table 4.1: predicted author gender using bag of words.

Transforming the bag-of-words into bags of lexical categories reduces the number of dimensions and improves the interpretability of the results. Ensemble classification on Empath categories is about 70% accurate at classifying character gender (table ??). To examine the interaction between author gender and character writing, I plotted lexical category frequency for male and female characters by author gender.
