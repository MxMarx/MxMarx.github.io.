Marx 2020-02-20 1 Introduction I started this project with the goal of answering this question: “if you take a character in a novel and replace all direct references to their gender such as pronouns with gender-neutral alternatives, how accurately could you predict their gender?” As with all gender-adjacent research that examines differences, it is important to examine any potentially confounding variables and critically contextualize the results. In order to soundly research my original question, I expanded the scope of this project to explore how genre and author gender influence the portrayal of fictional characters. The embodied approach to cognition views cognition is situated: inseparable from context and grounded in the body. Culturally imposed perception of bodies shapes their interaction with the world. Through this lens, the body is formed through its perceptions of the self, and gendered stereotypes and expectations shape these perceptions and influence behavior (Huttunen, Kähkönen, and Enwald 2019; Lee 2016). When writing a novel, an author might image the perspective of their characters. By embodying their characters, the author’s cognition becomes grounded in an imaged body and their writing might reflect their interpretation of the body. Gendered stereotypes influence behavior. The embodied approach to cognition views cognition as grounded in the body, so socially imposed perceptions of body might shape gendered behavior (Lee 2016). While writing a novel, an author might image the perspective of their characters. By embodying a character, the author’s cognition becomes grounded in an imaged body, and their expectations of the body might be reflected in their writing. The interpretation and generalization of gender differences risks perpetuating stereotypes and gender essentialism (Koolen and Cranenburgh 2017). Examining gender differences in fictional characters provides an opportunity to explore gender stereotypes and examine potentially confounding variables in the interpretation of lexical differences between male and female authors. Viewing gender through the lens of performativity is sometimes used to invalidate self-determined queer and trans identities, but TERFs can f— off (Finlay 2017). "],
["methods.html", "2 Methods 2.1 Book corpus 2.2 Natural language processing 2.3 Differential expression", " 2 Methods 2.1 Book corpus This study used 6,462 of the 10,000 most popular books listed on goodreads.com (Zając 2018). Author gender was estimated from their names cross-referenced with baby name popularity from 20-60 years prior to publication date (Social Security Administration 2019). When multiple authors were listed, the first author’s name was used. I manually annotated the most common authors whose first name was abbreviated, or not listed in the database. This method doesn’t account for ghost writers, pen names, multiple authors, writers born outside the United States, or name-gender discrepancies (for example, a person named “Russell” could be non-binary). To estimate this method’s accuracy, I manually reviewed 100 entries and found 2 incorrectly gendered authors. Gender is not binary, and binary classification of author gender is only a computationally convenient approximation. 2.2 Natural language processing Lemmatization and part-of-speech tagging was performed with Spacy (Honnibal and Montani 2017), and character coreferences were resolved with NeuralCoref (Chaumond 2019). Individual characters were defined as entities with 25 or more coreferenced pronouns. Character gender was determined by gendered pronoun usage. Only characters whose gender was estimated with at least 90% accuracy were included. For each character, a bags-of-word was extracted for each sentence where they were referenced. 2.3 Differential expression The assumptions made when compare bags-of-words are remarkably similar to those in analyzing differential expression of next-gen RNA sequencing data. I took advantage of this by using DESeq2 (Love, Huber, and Anders 2014) to apply generalized linear models with a negative binomial distribution to estimate differences in word frequency between male and female characters and authors.

["results-genre.html", "3 Results - Genre 3.1 Author gender by genre 3.2 Character gender by genre 3.3 Classifying author gender using genre tags 3.4 Character frequency", " 3 Results - Genre 3.1 Author gender by genre I classified book genre using tags listed by Goodreads.com. To examine how genres cluster together, I created a nearest neighbor graph from the cosine similarity between tag frequencies for the top 150 tags in the dataset (fig 3.1). Overlaying this graph with author gender show rather strong divisions between author genders for certain genres (fig 3.2). Since Goodreads tags are crowdsourced and created by readers, and readership and book reviews show gender bias (Thelwall 2019), the apparent gender-genre gap might not be reflected in the text itself. The list of tags and their frequency across author genders are in (table 7.1). Figure 3.1: Nearest neighbor graph generated by book tag similarity, colored by genre. Hover over points to view the data! Figure 3.2: Nearest neighbor graph generated by book tag similarity, colored by author gender. 3.2 Character gender by genre Graphs get messy, so I made a table showing the number of books written by male and female authors in each genre (fig 3.3). In addition, the character gender ratio varies substantially across both author gender and genre (fig 3.4). Figure 3.3: Author gender discrepancy by genre. Figure 3.4: Character gender discrepancy by author gender. 3.3 Classifying author gender using genre tags Genre tags alone can classify author gender with 83% accuracy (table 3.1). Again, this might reflect gender bias in genre attrbituion, not just textual differences between authors (Thelwall 2019). The list of tags can be found in (table 7.1). Table 3.1: Predicted author gender using tags Predicted Male Predicted Female Male Authors 1822 319 Female Authors 430 1938 3.4 Character frequency Female minor characters are relatively underrepresented, as shown by a slightly reduced proportion of characters that make fewer appearances in the text (fig 3.6). This might reflect the concept of “male-as-default”, where non-gender-specific characters are generally portrayed as male. Additionally, male characters are more frequently written as the subject (nsubj) of a sentence than a object (dobj), relative to female characters 3.5). Both of these differences were larger in male authors. Figure 3.5: Ratio of characters as subject vs object. Figure 3.6: Distribution of characters as percentage of total words.

["results-differential-expression.html", "4 Results - Differential Expression", " 4 Results - Differential Expression To compare lexicons for male and female characters across all authors, I used DESeq2 to compare word frequencies across character gender. This process is computationally intensive, so I only included the 10,000 most frequent words and 4000 characters with the highest read depth (the entire dataset includes 25,000 characters across 6000 books). Result are visualized in an interactive plot (fig 4.1). Differentially expressed words for female (table 6.1) and male (table 6.2) characters are included in the supplemental data. Figure 4.1: Differential word frequency by character gender Next, I compared lexicons for male and female authors (fig 4.2). A subjective assessment of the data suggests that these differences may largely are due to genre. Differentially expressed words are included in supplemental data (tables 6.3 and 6.4 ). Figure 4.2: Differential word frequency by author gender Words that are more frequently associated with male characters are also more frequently used by male authors (fig 4.3). The is likely a consequence of male authors more frequently writing male characters (fig (fig:characterCounts)). I haven’t figured out the best way to control for this difference. I might try weighting word frequency by character gender frequency. Figure 4.3: Correlation between word frequency across character and author gender Next, I trained an ensemble learner to classify characters (table 4.2) and authors (table 4.1) by gender using normalized word counts from DESeq2. This model is disturbingly good at classifying author gender. A bad interpretation would ignore confounding variables such as gender imbalances in genre. Goodreads.com tags are probably rather biased by author gender, and genre tags alone are only slightly less accurate at predicting author gender than the text (table 3.1). I’m not sure how to control for this. The distinction between male and female characters was slightly larger for male authors (fig. 4.4). Table 4.1: predicted author gender using bag of words. Predicted Male Predicted Female Male Authors 1522 298 Female Authors 292 1736 Table 4.2: Predicted character gender using bag of words. Predicted Male Predicted Female Male Characters 4262 738 Female Characters 806 4194 Figure 4.4: Character gender score using bag of words. "],
["results-empath-scores.html", "5 Results - EMPATH scores", " 5 Results - EMPATH scores Empath is a tool for generating high-quality lexical categories (Fast, Chen, and Bernstein 2016). Transforming the bag-of-words into bags of lexical categories reduces the number of dimensions and improves the interpretability of the results. To examine the interaction between author gender and character portrayal, I plotted lexical category frequency for male and female characters by author gender. Ensemble classification on Empath categories predicts character gender with an F1 score of 78.5% (table 5.1). The difference in gender score is larger for male authors compared to female authors (fig. 5.1). Table 5.1: Predicted character gender using EMPATH categories.
