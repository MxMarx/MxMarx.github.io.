# Results - EMPATH

*Empath* is a tool for generating high-quality lexical categories [@Fast2016]. Transforming the bag-of-words into bags of lexical categories reduces the number of dimensions and improves the interpretability of the results.

Ensemble classification on *Empath* categories is about 70% accurate at classifying character gender (table \@ref(tab:empathCharConfusion)).

To examine the interaction between author gender and character writing, I plotted lexical category frequency for male and female characters by author gender.




```{r empathCharConfusion, fig.cap="Predicted character gender using EMPATH categories."}
library(kableExtra)
DT = data.frame(TM=c(5793,2214), TF=c(1343,2323))
row.names(DT) <- c("True Male","True Female")

knitr::kable(DT, col.names = c("Predicted Male","Predicted Female"), caption = 'Predicted character gender using EMPATH categories.') %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = T)

```
