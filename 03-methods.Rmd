# Methods

## Book corpus

This study used 6,462 of the 10,000 most populared books listed on goodreads.com [@goodbooks-10k].

Author gender was estimated using baby name popularity from 20-60 years prior to publication date [@SocialSecurity]. When multiple authors were listed, the first author's name was used. I manually annotated the most common authors whose first name was not listed in the database. This method doesn't account for ghost writers, pen names, multiple authors, writers born outside the United States, or name-gender discrepancies (for example, a person named "Russell" could be non-binary rather than male). To estimate gender accuracy, I manually reviewed 100 entires and found 2 incorrently gendered authors.

Gender is not binary, and binary classification of author gender is only a convenient approximation.

## Natural language processing

Lemmatization and part-of-speech tagging was performed with Spacy [@spacy2], and character coreferences were resolved with NeuralCoref [@NeuralCoref].

Characters were defined as entities with 50 or more coreferenced pronouns. Character gender was determined by pronoun usage.

Bags-of-words were extracted for each sentence where a character was referenced.

## Differential expression
The assumptions when comparing bags of words are remarkably similar to those in analyzing differential expression of next-gen RNA sequencing data. I took advantage of this by using DESeq2 to [@DESeq2] apply generalized linear models with a negative binomial distribution to estimate differences in word frequency.
